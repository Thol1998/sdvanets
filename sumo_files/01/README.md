# :wrench: Setting up the scenario
Changing the standard sumo scenario of mininet-wifi. This changing is necessary to run our scenario. 

## Changing default files
```bash
~/sdvanets$ cd sumo_files/
~/sdvanets/sumo_files$ cp *.xml sumo.cfg PATH/mininet-wifi/mn_wifi/sumo/data/

~/sdvanets/sumo_files$ cd PATH/mininet-wifi/
~/mininet-wifi$ sudo make install
```
_note 1: PATH should be the real path to the directory mininet-wifi/ on your system_

_note 2: This scenario is syncronized with python scenario file_

>Every time that you change, this files you need to **execute the last command**.

## :warning: Important files
- route.rou.xml

    In that file you'll have the route settings of all the cars in SUMO. It's important to define exactly the same number of the cars here and the main scenario script.

- reroute.add.xml

    This file allows the cars to have route options to follow. For example at an intersection, they can follow any available path, based on a predefined probability

- net.net.xml

    This is a file generated by the NETCONVERT command available by SUMO itself through other subfiles ([edge, node, type].xml). It is from him that SUMO creates the scenario.

- sumo.cfg

    SUMO configuration file. It link all files cited above

> Be careful when you change some of this files, the synchronization with mininet-wifi can be affected.
